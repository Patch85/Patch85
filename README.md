Hi, I'm Dillon.

I'm a developer who is always interested in learning new things.
Right now, I've been exploring Laravel with Inertia and Vue.
In my day job, I work on a Synfony-based ERP system as well as a
number of other projects using Raspberry Pi in a manufacturing environment

When I'm not writing code for work or pleasure, I like to spend time...
- with my lovely wife, our 2 dogs and cat
- playing music
- brewing beer
- blacksmithing
- woodworking
- gardening
- more!
